# release 1.2

This is a feature add release.
- Adds bibliometric metadata and handling of multiple "vertiiical" sheets
- Adds autocreation of index file which summarises the metadata
- Adds additional tests

New features are:
- default scheme (`dmdScheme 0.9.9`) includes bibliometric metadata
- all functions can now handle multiple "vertical" tabs / sheets
- the function `make_index()` creates an index document which is, when pandoc is installed, converted to word, pdf or html format. This is based on a template file which contains tokens which are replaced with metadatafrom a supplied scheme.
- rewritten vignette

Make use of pandoc in examples as dontrun to make CRAN happy

# release 1.1.3

Fix https://github.com/Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdScheme/issues/23 which caused errors in validation due to CR LF versus LF in Excel sheet.

# release 1.0.0

* suggestedValues validation has been, in case of a fail, be declassified as a Note (previous: Warning).
* Include wildcards and regular expressions in columnName in DataFileMetaData. Wildcards (i.e. * and ?) have to be enclosed by three exclamation marks (`!!!`), e.g. `Species_!!!*!!!` which will match all `Species_1` as well as `Species_Not KnownSoFar`. Regular expressions do not need to be enclosed with any special characters.
