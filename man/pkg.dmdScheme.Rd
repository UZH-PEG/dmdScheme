\title{dmdScheme: A package containing the definition for a metadata scheme for Experimental Microcosm Ecological experiments.}
\description{
Metadata is essential for the managing of data. Consequentally, metadata
schemes play an importent role in this. Nevertheless (or because of this),
metadata schemes are usuallu big, complex, difficult to read and understant,
and, in consequence, are not used as often as they dshould be. Therefore, we
developed a metadata scheme, called \code{dmdScheme} which is focussed on one
homogeneous field, so that the metadata scheme is not to complex and can easiliy
used.
This package provides:
1) the authorative definition of the dmdScheme
2) object definitions for this scheme for R
3) Excel spreadsheet for entering the metadata for an experiment, i.e. multiple data files
4) functions to validate this metadata
5) functions to export the metadata to xml files, one per data file
}
